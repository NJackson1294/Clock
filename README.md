    The following project is a clock in which the user can add time to the clock in incraments of hours, minutes, and seconds. The program will display the time in 12-hour and 24-hour format. 
    I think that what I did particularly well was organizing my files and code in general. I think it is fairly legable and easy to interpret. 
    I did encounter a bug in my program that I was not able to resolve in which the time did not roll over correctly once it reached the next hour. 
    I would need to do further troubleshooting to narrow down the main reasopn as to why the issue was persisting. 
    Trying to set the conversion for the time from 24-hour to 12-hour was probably one of the more difficult challenges for me. 
    I found such resources like W3 Schools to be invaluable in referencing material to help arganize and understand some areas in which my code needed further work.
    I think organization in code and making sure to add comments to each area in which a method is being made is very beneficial for future reference if an issue should arise for any potential programmers that are trying to read it.
    I think making encapsulation was at the forefront of my mind when designing this program. As part of most object oriented principles, encapsulation definitely aids in making the program work via calling mewthods without having to know how the methods work.
